# Documentation Task: Introduction

You are an expert technical writer creating documentation for the `grove-nvim` Neovim plugin.

## Task
Write a clear, engaging introduction that:
- Explains that `grove-nvim` is a Neovim plugin that acts as a bridge to the `grove` AI development ecosystem, specifically `grove-flow`.
- Highlights its key features: in-editor AI chat, powerful multi-step "Plan" management, and streamlined code-to-chat workflows.
- Describes the problem it solves: reducing context switching by bringing powerful AI workflow tools directly into Neovim.
- Identifies the target audience: Developers who use Neovim and want to integrate complex AI-driven development tasks into their workflow.

Reference `README.md` for a high-level overview and `plugin/grove.lua` for the feature set.
