# Documentation Task: Installation Guide

You are an expert technical writer creating documentation for the `grove-nvim` Neovim plugin.

## Task
Write a comprehensive installation guide. The guide must include:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    - The `neogrove` binary itself (mention it's managed by the `grove` meta-tool).
    - The `grove-flow` binary (as `flow` in the PATH), which `neogrove` wraps.
    - `snacks.nvim` for the UI, as seen in `lua/grove-nvim/plan.lua`.

2.  **Plugin Installation**:
    - Provide example installation snippets for popular plugin managers like `lazy.nvim`.

## Output Format
- Use clear headings for each section (Prerequisites, Installation).
- Use code blocks for installation commands and configuration snippets.
- Be precise and clear, assuming the user is familiar with Neovim plugin management.
